Code and data for Stiller, Goodman, &amp; Frank, "Ad-hoc implicature in preschool children"

## Materials

Note that in an initial pilot version of the experiment, the "cookies" stimulus item was used. Due to children's strong preferences for different types of cookies, this stimulus item was replaced with the "bed" item shown in the file `materials/SCALES bed stimulus.pdf`.
